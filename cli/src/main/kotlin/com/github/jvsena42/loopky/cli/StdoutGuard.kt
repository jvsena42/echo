/**
 * Keep stdout for the result, whatever the layers underneath think.
 *
 * `--json` is a versioned API an agent parses (`SCHEMA_VERSION`), which only means anything if the
 * envelope is the sole thing on stdout. It was not: `libpubkycore` installs a `tracing` subscriber
 * whose default writer is **stdout**, so a DHT bootstrap failure — routine on a box that reaches
 * the homeserver fine over HTTPS — lands ahead of the envelope and `jq` and `json.load()` both
 * fail on it (#229). `2>/dev/null` does not help, and neither does `RUST_LOG`: quieting the
 * subscriber lowers the *odds* of a line rather than the guarantee, and an error is exactly the
 * thing that should still be reported.
 *
 * So the fix is a file descriptor, not a log level. `dup2(2, 1)` points **fd 1 itself** at stderr,
 * which catches everything writing to the raw descriptor — the Rust layer, anything it links, and
 * any future dependency that prints — and Kotlin's `System.out` is re-pointed at a `dup` of the
 * real stdout taken first. Nothing above has to cooperate, and there is nothing left to
 * accidentally leave on the wrong stream.
 *
 * [defaultRustLogToWarn] stays as it is and is not made redundant by this: it decides how much the
 * SDK says, this decides where it says it.
 *
 * Best-effort, like every other libc call here. A host where a symbol will not resolve keeps the
 * descriptors it had — noisy stdout is not a reason to refuse to run — and the caller is told, so
 * it never *reports* a clean channel it did not get.
