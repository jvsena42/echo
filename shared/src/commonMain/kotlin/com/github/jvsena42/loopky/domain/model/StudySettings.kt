 * line (SM-2's, which this used to floor at) would make `masteryShare` cap below 100% and
 * `isFullyMastered` return false forever, on every deck, with nothing reporting it. At 1/2/7 the
 * old formula gave 21 and no card could pass 7.
 *
 * What it now means in practice: a card counts as mastered once it is sitting on the longest
 * interval — normally, once you last graded it Easy. `maxOf` rather than [easyDays] because
 * ordering is not enforced; someone may set Hard higher than Easy.
